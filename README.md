- The goal of this project was to combine my interests in AI, Python, art, and design. 
- In this project I used a pre-trained data collection in the form of an xml file by opencv on Github (https://github.com/opencv). I have the exact file linked below as my second resource. 
- I also used code from this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIrOM9oP3pA) to learn an outlined framework of creating a basic face detection app, before implementing my own version to suit my project.
- I added my own images and altered the aesthetic preferencees, such as colors and line thicknesses, as well as implemented differences in functionality to better match the purpose of my project, such as adding iterations in order to detect multiple faces instead of just one, as well as detecting and printing the coordinates of each printed rectangle.
- Using Canva I created a layered collage of different scaled images which are all mine originally. I then converted the image file to a .png, added it to my project folder, and edited my code to work with the updated image in both functionality and visual appeal.
